            h1 Google Drive Userscript
            h2 Why?
            p.
              Since Google Drive support was launched in early 2014, it has broken
              at least 4-5 times, requiring increasing effort to get it working again
              and disrupting many channels.  This is because there is no official API
              for it like there is for YouTube videos, which means support for it
              relies on undocumented tricks.  In August 2016, the decision was made
              to phase out the native support for Google Drive and instead require
              users to install a userscript, which allows to bypass certain browser
              restrictions and make the code easier, simpler, and less prone to failure
              (it could still break due to future Google Drive changes, but is less
              likely to be difficult to fix).
            h2 How It Works
            p.
              The userscript is a short script that you can install using a browser
              extension such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey that runs on the page
              and provides additional functionality needed to play Google Drive
              videos.

                | Tampermonkey supports many browsers besides Chrome.
            p.
              Once you have installed the userscript manager addon for your browser,
              you can <a href="/js/cytube-google-drive.user.js" target="_blank">
              install the userscript</a>.  If this link 404s, it means the administrator
              of this server hasn't generated it yet.
