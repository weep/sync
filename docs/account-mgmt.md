## Registering an Account ##

To register an account, click the Account dropdown on the top bar, then click Register.  This option will only appear if you are not already logged in.  When choosing a username, make sure it meets the following requirements:

  * Must be 1-20 characters long
  * May only contain the letters 'A' through 'Z' (upper or lowercase), the digits '0' through '9', hyphens '-', and underscores '_'

Be sure to pick a strong password that is not easy to guess and is not the same as your accounts on other websites.  Entering an email address is optional, and will allow you to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

## Changing your Password or Email Address ##

On the top bar of the website, click Account, then "Change Password/Email".  You must provide your current password in order to change either of these.  You can leave the email address box blank if you wish to remove the email address from your account (note that this means you will no longer be able to receive password reset emails).

## Recovering an Account If You Lost the Password ##

From the login page, click "Forgot password?"  You will be prompted to enter your username and email address.  The email address must match the one associated with your account.  If you have not added an email address to your account, you cannot reset your password automatically and will need to contact an administrator for help.  Otherwise, you will receive an email with a link to reset your password.

## Account Profile ##

Each CyTube account can set a profile photo and short description.  On the top bar, click Account, then Profile.  You can then enter the URL of a profile image, and enter a short text blurb that will be displayed when users hover over your name in the chat username list.  Note that this is publicly visible to anyone, so don't use a private photo or include private information in your description.
