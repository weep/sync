# User Guide #

This user guide is a work in progress rewrite of the old user guide.  If you notice something is missing, it probably hasn't been ported over from [here](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync/wiki/CyTube-3.0-User-Guide) yet.

## I want to know more about... ##

* [Registering and managing my user account](account-mgmt.md)
* [Available user preferences](user-settings.md)
* [Adding subtitles to Google Drive videos](google-drive-subtitles.md)
* [Managing chat filters](chat-filters.md)

## I need help! ##

1. Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) and check whether that answers your question.
2. If not, you can contact someone for help.  IRC support is provided on `irc.6irc.net #cytube` ([webchat](https://webchat.6irc.net/?channels=cytube) available) for http://cytu.be, http://synchtu.be, and general questions about using the software.  If nobody is available on IRC, or you want to speak privately, email one of the contacts on https://cytu.be/contact.
