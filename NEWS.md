==========

A new dependency has been added on `cytube-common`, a module that will hold
common code shared between the current version of CyTube and the upcoming work
around splitting it into multiple services.  You will need to be sure to run
`npm install` after pulling in this change to pull in the new dependency.

This release updates socket.io to version 1.4.0.  The updates to socket.io
include a few security-related fixes, so please be sure to run `npm install`
to ensure the updated version is installed before restarting your CyTube server.

In order to support future clustering support, the legacy `/sioconfig`
endpoint is being deprecated.  Instead, you should make a request to
`/socketconfig/<channel name>.json`.  See [the
documentation](docs/socketconfig.md) for more information.

  * The channel data storage system has been refactored a bit.  For
    compatibility, the default remains to store JSON objects for each channel in
    the `chandump` folder, however there is now also the option of storing
    channel data in the database.  You can take advantage of this by setting
    `channel-storage: type: 'database'` in your `config.yaml`.
    - In order to migrate existing channel data from the `chandump` files to the
      database, run `node lib/channel-storage/migrate.js`.
  * The database storage method uses foreign keys to associate the channel data
    with the corresponding row in the `channels` table.  This requires that the
    tables be stored using the InnoDB engine rather than MyISAM.  If your CyTube
    tables defaulted to MyISAM, you can fix them by running

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `channels` ENGINE = InnoDB;
    ```

  * CyTube is now transpiled with [babel] to allow the use of ES6/ES2015
    features.  All source files have been moved from `lib` to `src`.
  * Running `npm install` or `npm run postinstall` will prompt you to
    build from `src` to `lib`.
  * Running `npm run build-server` will run the build script without any
    prompts.
  * After updating with `git pull`, you should run `npm install` or `npm run
    build-server` in order to rebuild after the changes.

  * CyTube now supports subtitles for Google Drive videos.  In order to take
    advantage of this, you must upgrade mediaquery by running `npm install
    cytube/mediaquery`.  Subtitles are cached in the google-drive-subtitles
    folder.

2015-07-07
==========

  * CyTube and CyTube/mediaquery have both been updated to use
    calzoneman/status-message-polyfill to polyfill res.statusMessage on older
    versions of node (e.g., v0.10).  After pulling, run `npm install` to update
    this dependency.  This fixes an issue where HTTP status messages from
    mediaquery were reported as `undefined`, and removes the need for manually
    looking up status messages in `lib/ffmpeg.js`.

2015-07-06
==========

  * As part of the video player rewrite, Google Drive and Google+ metadata
    lookups are now offloaded to CyTube/mediaquery.  After pulling the new
    changes, run `npm install` or `npm update` to update the mediaquery
    dependency.

  * `www/js/player.js` is now built from the CoffeeScript source files in the
    `player/` directory.  Instead of modifying it directly, modify the relevant
    player implementations in `player/` and run `npm run build-player` (or `node
    build-player.js`) to generate `www/js/player.js`.

  * Also as part of the video player rewrite, the schema for custom embeds
    changed so any custom embeds stored in the `channel_libraries` table need to
    be updated.  The automatic upgrade script will convert any custom embeds
    that are parseable (i.e., not truncated by the width of the `id` field using
    the old format) and will delete the rest (you may see a lot of WARNING:
    unable to convert xxx messages-- this is normal).  Custom embeds in channel
    playlists in the chandumps will be converted when the channel is loaded.
